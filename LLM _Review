Using SU Men’s Basketball 2024–25 Season Data to Support Coaching Decisions: Ethical, Reliable, and Actionable Recommendations

Executive Summary

This report analyzes Syracuse University Men’s Basketball team statistics from the 2024–25 season to provide actionable recommendations for the coaching staff. Based on descriptive statistics, an LLM-generated narrative, and statistical validation, we propose a tiered set of recommendations:

Operational (Low Risk): Introduce targeted shooting and conditioning drills to address second-half shooting decline among guards.

Investigatory (Medium Risk): Collect player-tracking and biometric data to validate fatigue-related performance drops.

High Stakes (High Risk): Consider rotational adjustments for underperforming players only after multi-game, multi-season validation with oversight from performance staff.

Confidence: Moderate. Supported by bootstrapping and subgroup checks, though data gaps (injury reports and incomplete shot-tracking logs) reduce certainty.

Background & Decision Context

This report is addressed to the SU Men’s Basketball Head Coach and Athletic Director.

Decision Question: Should the coaching staff adjust training programs, player workloads, or rotation strategies to address performance declines late in games?

Risk Level: Medium. Low-risk drills are straightforward, while roster or playing-time decisions affect athlete careers.

Stake: Team competitiveness, athlete health, and adherence to NCAA fairness policies.

Data & Provenance

Source: SU Athletics Department game logs (Nov 2024 – Feb 2025).

Sample: 28 games, 15 rostered players.

Metrics Collected: Points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, shooting accuracy (by half), minutes played.

Limitations:

8% missing substitution timing data.

No biometric data (heart rate, fatigue indicators).

Privacy/Ethics: All data anonymized prior to analysis.

Methods

Descriptive Stats (Replicated in Python, Pandas, Polars):

Average team points per game: 72.4 (95% CI: 69.0–75.7)

FG% overall: 43% (SD = 9%)

Turnovers per game: 13.2 (SD = 4.1)

LLM Narrative Generation (from Task 6):

Prompt: “Summarize player fatigue and scoring trends in SU Men’s Basketball 2024–25 season.”

Raw Output: Claimed “consistent second-half collapse.”

Annotated Edit: Adjusted to “second-half decline in ~65% of games.”

Uncertainty Quantification:

Bootstrapping (1,000 samples): guards’ FG% decline after halftime = −9% (95% CI: −14% to −4%).

Sanity Checks:

Outlier: Player 3 averaged 28 PPG (3 SD above mean). Removing Player 3 did not change team-wide trends.

Bias & Fairness:

Minutes distribution by class year (freshmen vs. seniors) showed no systemic bias.

Robustness:

Results stable when normalizing FG% by minutes played.

Findings

Shooting Decline: Guards’ FG% fell from 45% in first half to 36% in second half.

Turnovers: Increased late in games (avg. 5 in final 10 minutes vs. 3 in first 10 minutes).

Statistical Significance: FG% decline robust (bootstrap CI excludes 0).

Narrative Confirmation: LLM narrative correctly identified fatigue but overstated magnitude.

Visualization:

Line chart: FG% by game half.

Histogram: Turnovers per game.

Recommendations (Tiered by Risk)
Operational (Low Risk)

Introduce late-game shooting and ball-handling drills in practice.

Rationale: Guards’ shooting and turnovers decline late in games.

Confidence: Moderate.

Investigatory (Medium Risk)

Begin pilot biometric and tracking program (e.g., Catapult sensors) to assess fatigue and recovery.

Rationale: Performance drop likely linked to fatigue, but evidence indirect.

Confidence: Low until new data collected.

High Stakes (High Risk)

Reevaluate guard rotation strategy (e.g., reducing minutes of underperforming players).

Rationale: May improve late-game performance, but carries ethical and career risks.

Confidence: Low; requires multi-season validation and human oversight.

Ethical & Legal Concerns

LLM-Generated Content: Clearly labeled; not sole decision basis.

Data Privacy: NCAA compliance; no identifiers included.

Fairness: No class-year or subgroup disparities detected, but monitoring needed.

Accountability: Human coaches/athletic staff must make final decisions.
