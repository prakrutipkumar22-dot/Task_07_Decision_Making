# Task_07_Decision_Making
stakeholder-facing decision report designed for the SU Menâ€™s Basketball coaching staff
I used model: GPT-4o to actually jsut see how the model runs and answers Q&As without actually feeding data.
I was curious to find where it took data from, did it remember from the previous data feeded or created its own.
Gpt simply fabricated the data.
I am further using this outcomes on the real data to figure out what Solutions I can get with the analysis.
I will share the gpt answers in another file.
